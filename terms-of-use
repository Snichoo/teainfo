  <h2>3. Subscription Services</h2>

  <h3>A. Subscriptions Services</h3>
  <p>We may offer certain products and services for purchase ("Subscription Services") through the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store ("Third-Party Account") for a recurring monthly fee (the "Subscription Fee"). If you subscribe to the Subscription Services, you will be required to authorize the Subscription Fee with the Third-Party Account. Your "Subscription Period" is the interval of time between each recurring billing date and corresponds to the term of the Subscription Services. The terms of Subscription Fee and the Subscription Period will be presented to you at the time you authorize payment via the Third-Party Account. At the beginning of each Subscription Period, we will charge you a periodic Subscription Fee on a recurring basis corresponding to the terms of the Subscription Services and any applicable taxes. You are solely responsible for any and all fees charged to your Third-Party Account. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Subscription Services will automatically renew for the Subscription Period unless and until you cancel the Subscription Services, or your Account is otherwise suspended or terminated pursuant to Section 6(B) of these Terms. <strong>ALL PURCHASES, INCLUDING RECURRING CHARGES, ARE FINAL.</strong></p>

  <h3>B. Additional Terms for Subscriptions via Third Party Accounts</h3>
  <p>If you obtain Subscription Services via a Third-Party Account that subscription is also subject to the Third-Party Account's terms. Any Subscription Fees or other applicable charges will be billed by the applicable Third-Party Account using the payment information you have provided to such third party. To cancel a subscription to the Service(s) obtained via a Third-Party Account, please follow the cancellation instructions set out by the applicable Third-Party Account and/or as described below. If the Third-Party Account is unable to secure funds from you for the Subscription Fees for any reason, including, but not limited to, insufficient funds or insufficient or inaccurate information provided when submitting electronic payment, Hylite Labs may undertake further collection action, including application of fees to the extent permitted by law, and reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Subscription Services. You agree to waive all claims against Hylite Labs and its affiliates related to any unauthorized payments made on or through the use of your Third-Party Account outside of Hylite Labs' control, regardless of whether such payments are authorized or unauthorized.</p>

  <h3>C. Changes to Pricing and Other Terms</h3>
  <p>Hylite Labs reserves the right to change the terms of the Subscription Services, including the Subscription Fee, from time to time, effective as of the beginning of your next Subscription Period following the date of the change. We will give you advance notice of these changes. In the event of any increase in the price or material reduction in the features of the Subscription Services, we will communicate these change(s) to you at least thirty (30) days in advance and the changes will only take effect with respect to any renewal of the Subscription Services following the applicable thirty (30) day period. You can cancel the Subscription Services prior to the effective date of the changes by following the instructions provided by the applicable Third-Party Account. If you do not cancel the Subscription Services prior to the applicable effective date of the changes, the Subscription Service will be modified to reflect the applicable change to the Subscription Fee.</p>
